<h4> Lizards: Binomial mixture model for modelling and estimation of abundance in the presence of imperfect detection  </h4>(Contributed by Marc Kery)<br/><br/>Abundance, or population size, is the central quantity in much of ecology (e.g., Krebs, <em>Addison Wesley</em>, 2001). Abundance is assessed by counting individuals, and patterns in abundance are typically modelled by assuming some sort of a Poisson GLM for these counts. This approach neglects the important fact that almost universally some individuals are overlooked; i.e., individual detection probability is arguably always less than 1 in the field. This means that counts usually underestimate true abundance. Worse yet, covariates that affect detectability may mask true covariate relationships with abundance, distort them or feign spurious abundance relationships.<br/><br/>Historically, two approaches to correct for imperfect detection and thus to estimate true abundance are distance sampling (Buckland <em>et al.</em>, 2001, 2004) and capture-recapture (Williams et al., <em>Academic Press</em>, 2002). A third, "cheaper" method (in terms of field protocol) is the binomial mixture or N - mixture model (Royle, <em>Biometrics</em>, 2004). Based on counts that are replicated both over multiple sites and multiple surveys within a time period of geographic and demographic closure, abundance and detection probability can be estimated separately along with their relationships with measured covariates. Here, we present a hierarchical, or state-space, implementation of the model that explicitly contains parameters for the latent state N<sub>i</sub>, that is, abundance at site i.<br/><br/>This model is structurally similar to the site-occupancy model (see Gentians example), the main difference being that as a model for the latent state the Poisson is chosen rather than the Bernoulli. Like the site-occupancy model (see there), the binomial mixture model can be fitted in WinBUGS in a "square data format", where rows denote sites and columns repeated surveys. However, for imbalanced data, a "vertical data format" is more convenient and for illustration, we show this here (the site-occupancy model can also be fitted in this format).<br/><br/>We describe count y<sub>i</sub> at site<sub>i</sub> by two linked equations:<br/><br/>      N<sub>site</sub><sub>i </sub>~ Poisson(lambda<sub>site</sub><sub>i</sub>)<br/><br/>      y<sub>i</sub> ~ Binomial(p<sub>i</sub>, N<sub>site</sub><sub>i</sub>)   <br/><br/>Again, like in the case of the site-occupancy model, the first line describes the true biological process: true abundance, the latent state N<sub>site</sub><sub>i</sub>, i.e., local population size N at population<sub>i</sub>. The simplest distributional assumption is that of a Poisson distribution, but other distributions like the negative binomial are also possible or one could model a normal random effect into log(lambda). Given the particular realisation of the Poisson random process, i.e., a particular N<sub>site</sub><sub>i</sub>, the observed data, count y<sub>i</sub>, follows a binomial distribution indexed by local population size and "success probability" = detection probability p<sub>i</sub>. Covariate effects can be modelled into the Poisson and the Binomial mean in a simple GLM fashion.<br/><br/>This binomial mixture model example, though inspired by nature (Kéry <em>et al.</em>, in press) is based on simulated data of replicated counts of sand lizards (Lacerta agilis) in The Netherlands. Lizards were counted at 200 survey sites three times during a time period when the population was assumed closed. True abundance was assumed to be positively related to vegetation density (scaled -1 to 1) but detection probability was assumed to be lower in higher than in lower vegetation, and in addition, positively affected by temperature (scaled -1 to 1).<br/><br/><strong>Hints:</strong> Good starting values can be essential for fitting the model successfully. One plus the max observed at each site is a good choice. Scaling of covariates is also important.<br/><br/><br/>model <br/>   {      # Binomial mixture model for 'vertical' data format<br/># Priors<br/>alpha.lam ~ dunif(-10, 10)<br/>beta.lam ~ dunif(-10, 10)<br/>alpha.p ~ dunif(-10, 10) <br/>beta1.p ~ dunif(-10, 10)<br/>beta2.p ~ dunif(-10, 10)<br/><br/># Likelihood<br/># Biological model for true abundance<br/>for (i in 1:R) {# Loop over R sites<br/>N[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i])<br/>         # Constrain the N[i] to be less than 50<br/>         q[i] &lt;- step(50 - N[i])<br/>         constraint[i] &lt;- 1<br/>         constraint[i] ~ dbern(q[i])<br/>log(lambda[i]) &lt;- alpha.lam + beta.lam * vege.lam[i]<br/>}<br/><br/># Observation model for replicated counts<br/>for (i in 1:n) {# Loop over all n observations<br/>C[i] ~ dbin(p[i], N[site[i]])<br/>lin.pred[i] &lt;- alpha.p + beta1.p * vege.p[i] + beta2.p * temperature[i]<br/>p[i] &lt;- exp(lin.pred[i]) / (1 + exp(lin.pred[i]))<br/>}<br/><br/># Derived quantities<br/>   totalN &lt;- sum(N[ ]) # Estimate total population size across all sites<br/>      totalLambda &lt;- sum(lambda[])<br/>}<br/><br/><a href="/examples/latest/Lizardsdata.html"></a><div><h5>Data</h5><details><code>

Also, they are almost identical to the MLE's obtained by maximising the likelihood numerically in R (see Kéry <em>et al.</em>, <em>Ecol. Appl.</em>, 2005): 2.142415, -1.258583, 1.113543, -3.169582, and 2.014300. In addition, the estimate of totalN should be compared to known total population size across all 200 sites of 1700, with a sum of site maxima of only 692 observed lizards. In contrast, a naïve Poisson regression on observed max counts for each site is totally unable to pick up the positive effect of vegetation on abundance and vastly underestimates abundance.<br/>   <br/>
